- __init__.py is an empty file that instructs Python to treat this directory as a Python package.

- settings.py contains all the website settings, including registering any applications we create, the location of our static files, 
    database configuration details, etc.

- urls.py defines the site URL-to-view mappings. While this could contain all the URL mapping code, it is more common to delegate some of the mappings to 
    particular applications, as you'll see later.

- wsgi.py is used to help your Django application communicate with the webserver. You can treat this as boilerplate.

- asgi.py is a standard for Python asynchronous web apps and servers to communicate with each other. ASGI is the asynchronous successor to WSGI and provides 
    a standard for both asynchronous and synchronous Python apps (whereas WSGI provided a standard for synchronous apps only). It is backward-compatible with 
    WSGI and supports multiple servers and application frameworks.
